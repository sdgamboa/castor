# Given a rooted tree, calculate various measures of tree imbalance
# Supported imbalance types:
#	Sackin (sum of tip distances to root, counted in number of edges). [Sackin 1972. "Good" and "Bad" Phenograms. Systematic Biology. 21:225-226]
#	Colless (non-normalized, differences of tip_counts between a node's children summed across nodes). [Shao 1990. Tree Balance. Systematic Biology. 39:266-276]
#	Colless_normalized (normalized by the maximum possible value for bifurcating trees)
#	Blum (sum of logarithms of node sizes). [Blum and Francois (2006). Which random processes describe the Tree of Life? A large-scale study of phylogenetic tree imbalance. Systematic Biology. 55:685-691]
# Requirements:
#	The input tree must be rooted
#   The input tree can be multifurcating and/or monofurcating
