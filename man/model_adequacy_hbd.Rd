\title{
Check if a birth-death model adequately explains a timetree.
}
\description{
Given a rooted ultrametric timetree and a homogenous birth-death model, check if the model adequately explains various aspects of the tree, such as the branch length and node age distributions and other test statistics. The function uses bootstrapping to simulate multiple hypothetical trees according to the model and then compares the distribution of those trees to the original tree. This function may be used to quantify the "goodness of fit" of a birth-death model to a timetree.

\arguments{
\item{tree}{
A rooted ultrametric timetree of class "phylo".
}
\item{models}{
\itemize{Either a single HBD model or a list of HBD models, specifying the pool of models from which to randomly draw bootstraps. Every model should itself be a named list with some or all of the following elements: 
\item \code{ages}: Numeric vector, specifying discrete ages (times before present) in ascending order, on which the pulled speciation rate will be specified. Age increases from tips to root; the youngest tip in the input tree has age 0. The age grid must cover the present-day (age 0) and the root
\item \code{PSR}: Numeric vector of size NG, listing the pulled speciation rate (PSR) of the HBD model at the corresponding \code{ages}. Between grid points, the PSR is assumed to either be constant (if \code{splines_degree=0}), or linearly (if \code{splines_degree=1}) or quadratically (if \code{splines_degree=2}) or cubically (if \code{splines_degree=3}). To calculate the PSR of an HBD model based on the speciation and extinction rate, see \code{\link{simulate_deterministic_hbd}}.
}
}
\item{splines_degree}{
Integer, one of 0, 1, 2 or 3, specifying the polynomial degree of the PSR between age-grid points. For example, \code{splines_degree=0} means piecewise constant, \code{splines_degree=1} means piecewise linear and so on.
}
\item{extrapolate}{
Logical, specifying whether to extrapolate the model variables \eqn{\lambda}, \eqn{\mu}, \eqn{\psi} and \eqn{\kappa} (as constants) beyond the provided age grid all the way to \code{stem_age} and \code{end_age} if needed.
}
\item{Nbootstraps}{
Integer, the number of bootstraps (simulations) to perform for calculating statistical significances. A larger number will increase the accuracy of estimated statistical significances.
}
\item{Nthreads}{
Integer, number of parallel threads to use for bootstrapping. Note that on Windows machines this option is ignored.
}
}


\details{
In addition to model selection, the adequacy of any chosen model should also be assessed in absolute terms, i.e. not just relative to other competing models (after all, all considered models might be bad). This function essentially determines how probable it is for hypothetical trees generated by a candidate model to resemble the tree at hand, in terms of various test statistics (such as the historically popular "gamma" statistic, or the Colless tree imbalance). In particular, the function uses a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check whether the probability distributions of edge lengths and node ages in the tree resemble those expected under the model. All statistical significances are calculated using bootstrapping, i.e. by simulating trees from the provided model with the same number of tips and the same root age as the original tree.

Note that even if an HBD model appears to adequately explain a given timetree, this does not mean that the model even approximately resembles the true diversification history (i.e., the true speciation and extinction rates) that generated the tree (Louca and Pennell 2020). Hence, it is generally more appropriate to say that a given model "congruence class" (or PSR) rather than a specific model (speciation rate, extinction rate, and sampling fraction) explains the tree.

This function requires that the HBD model (or more precisely, its congruence class) be defined in terms of the PSR. If your model is defined in terms of speciation/extinction rates and a sampling fraction, or if your model's congruence class is defined in terms of the pulled diversification rate (PDR) and the product \eqn{\rho\lambda_o}, then you can use \code{\link{simulate_deterministic_hbd}} to first calculate the corresponding PSR.
}

\value{
A named list with the following elements:
\item{success}{
Logical, indicating whether the model evaluation was successful. If \code{FALSE}, then an additional return variable, \code{error}, will contain a description of the error; in that case all other return variables may be undefined. Note that \code{success} does not say whether the model explains the tree, but rather whether the computation was performed without errors.
